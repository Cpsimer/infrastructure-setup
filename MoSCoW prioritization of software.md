# MoSCoW Prioritization of Software

## Must Have

- Kubernetes
- NIM Interface Hub deployment (NVIDIA NIM Microservices)
- Nemo (NVIDIA NeMo Framework)
- Docker Engine
  - Configured on every device
- TensorRT (TensorRT for inference optimization)
- PyTorch (Core ML framework)
- LoRA Adapters
- n8n (Workflow automation with AI)
- NVIDIA Dynamo Platform
  - Triton (NVIDIA Dynamo-Triton)
  - Dynamo
- CUDA-X Libraries (Accelerated computing libs)
- gigabyte ai 4.1.1

## Should Have

- Magnum IO (IO acceleration for data centers)
- Aerial SDK
- Nsight (NVIDIA Nsight Developer Tools)
- PyG (PyTorch Geometric for graph ML)
- RAPIDS (GPU-accelerated data science)
- TensorFlow (Alternative ML framework)

## Could Have

- Jupyter (Interactive notebooks)
- NVIDIA Aerial for 5G RAN, latest: 25-2 incl.
- Omniverse Digital Twin
- Sionna (Open-Source Library for wireless sim, latest: 1.1.0)
- Some sort of prototyping UI
  - Useful expansions: n8n for automating Obsidian integrations (e.g., AI chats); Aerial/Sionna for edge/6G research if extending to wireless KM (e.g., mobile docking); UI tools for prototyping Obsidian dashboards. Low priority as not core to code/repo focus, but could optimize if scaling to visual AI (e.g., 10-20% workflow speedup)."

## Won't Have (Defer or exclude; low alignment)

- Blender (3D creation)
- Get Aerial CUDA-Accelerated RAN 24-3 (Older version; consolidate to 25-2)
