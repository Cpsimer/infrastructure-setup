Digital data deliveries have primarily been represented by digital scans of documents or in nonmachine-readable PDF (scanned/raster format) and stored in a file system or content management system. This approach to data interoperability has fallen short in that data delivered as part of a page-formatted document lack the relevant context required to effectively leverage the data access and interoperability potential inherent to digital assets.

Digital data standardization provides:
- Consistency of data and data use across systems.
- Minimal redundant data collection and entry
- Maximum utilization of relevant technology
- Improved audit trail accessibility.
- Rapid retrieval of the audit trail, enabling:
	- Better informed, real-time management decisions concerning changes
	- Increased quality in CDM and control
	- Support for effectiveness of analyses of metrics.
	- Improved data acquisition times
	- Improved data review and integration for elimination of manual management of relationships between data
