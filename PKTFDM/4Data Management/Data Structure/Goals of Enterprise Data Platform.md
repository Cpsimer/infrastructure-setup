# What to Avoid Designing data

- SILOED DATA SETS
	- Data (e.g. Science, Engineering, Flight, Safety, Financial, etc.) scattered across independently managed systems leads to redundancy and confusion among end users and inconsistent reporting and analytical result
- Exporting 
	- Exporting data for analysis is limiting and time consuming as data analysts spend large portion of time on data cleansing tasks with limited resources
- Lack of central system in place
	- Without a centralized data asset catalog, analysts lack the necessary tools for optimal collaboration and validation
