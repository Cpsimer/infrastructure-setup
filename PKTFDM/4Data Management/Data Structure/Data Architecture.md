Data Architecture describes how data are processed, stored, and utilized in a given system or product definition. It provides criteria for data processing operations that make it possible to design data flows and also control the flow and association of data in the system. If programs/projects do not have the Data Architecture from the start, the program/project data becomes disorganized quickly and is nearly impossible to electronically integrate or discover as the level of data increases over time.

The Data Architecture provides for creation, storage, and exchange of data, especially PDD, models and simulations, and for the requirements imposed on the MBE solution elements to support data interoperability, management, integration, metadata, and work practices, including, but not limited to, standardized taxonomies and ontologies, and should be based on common, open standard

The CIO provides the infrastructure/systems for implementing an architecture that supports the creation, storage, interoperability, and exchange of data. Engineering defines the program/project data that the architecture has to support and the criteria for data processing operations, data flows, and the association of data in the system. Further, engineering supplies the requirements for the infrastructure/systems needed to meet these criteria. The program/project manager and delegated Technical Authority(s) are responsible for ensuring that the Data Architecture meets the program/projectâ€™s needs. The program/project Data Architecture should be defined and documented in the MBE Plan
