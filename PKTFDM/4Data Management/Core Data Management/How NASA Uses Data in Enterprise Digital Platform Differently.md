 NASA Program Management created a framework for digital transformation anchored around a set of identified Strategic Thrusts (ST). STs are shared enterprise-level digital enablers that the Agency can use as catalysts to accelerate the enterprise transformations noted above. Six primary STs are identified as the core catalysts for NASAâ€™s digital transformation: 
 1. **Process Transformation** (PTx): Transform products and processes to maximize efficiency and effectiveness to enable bolder missions faster. 
 2. **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)**: Harness machine capabilities to augment human intelligence in an era of big data. 
 3. **Model Based Everything** (MBx): Employ digital models to enable our people to address increasing complexity, scope, speed, uncertainty & changes. 
 4. **Data**: Ensure the data we need is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Understandable, Secure, and Trustworthy (FAIRUST) to power data-driven decision making. 
 5. **Collaboration**: Enable agile teaming via seamless, secure internal and external collaboration 
 6. **Culture & Workforce**: Foster digital savvy, enterprise connection, and growth mindsets across the Agency
