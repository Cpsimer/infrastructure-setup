Planning how to FAIRify your data in the early stages of your research project will help you save time and resources later on. In practice, this means writing a data management plan, or DMP. A DMP is also where you document how you will collect, store, process, share and dispose of your data. Planning the management and FAIRification of your data minimizes the risk of problems at a later stage - be these technical, legal, or practical.

Remember that making your data FAIR is a gradual process with small steps one at a time. So, think about how your data will be created, collected, documented, stored, shared, archived, and 
preserved - and how you can make them FAIR at each step.

Planning your data documentation lays the foundation for the rest of your research project. Imagine you would like to use another researcherâ€™s dataset. If clear documentation is not provided, the data are not FAIR - and you will not be able to interpret the data. Depending on the type of research you conduct, you would document different elements of your research process, for instance your data collection methods, the code book, trial protocols, your device settings, or your laboratory procedures. For your specific project, other documentation requirements may apply

This guide is divided into four parts:
Core Requirements for Data Management 
- Plans: six aspects that every DMP should cover, with detailed guiding questions.
Criteria for the Selection of Trustworthy Repositories: 
	1. Data description and collection or re-use of existing data 
		1. a. How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used? 
		2. b. What data (for example the kinds, formats, and volumes) will be collected or produced? '
	2. Documentation and data quality 
		1. a. What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organizing data) will accompany data? 
		2. b. What data quality control measures will be used? 
	3. Storage and backup during the research process 
		1. a. How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research process? 
		2. b. How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research? 
	4. Legal and ethical requirements, codes of conduct 
		1. a. If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on data security be ensured? 
		2. b. How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable? c. How will possible ethical issues be taken into account, and codes of conduct followed?
	5. Data sharing and long-term preservation 
		1. a. How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo reasons? 
		2. b. How will data for preservation be selected, and where will data be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)? 
		3. c. What methods or software tools will be needed to access and use the data? 
		4. d. How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?
	6. Data management responsibilities and resources 
		1. a. Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)? 
		2. b. What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be **FAIR**
- four topics detailing criteria that every trusted repository should meet.
Guidance for Researchers: 
- more detailed information and examples to support researchers in complying with organizational requirements.
Guidance for Reviewers: 
- guidance to support the evaluation of DMPs by reviewers, aligned with the DMP core requirements presented in previous chapter
