- Conceptual TDP.
	A conceptual package is a collection of sketches, low fidelity computer-aided design (CAD) models, and text that document basic concepts of how an item may be developed to meet operational requirements. The TDP is used to determine if the requirements are feasible.
- Developmental TDP
	- A developmental package is a collection of data intended to document a specific design approach and the fabrication of a developmental prototype for test or experimentation. These data elements capture the basic design of equipment/systems developed from a concept. They are not intended, nor are they adequate, for use in the competitive procurement of component parts
- Product TDP
	- A product package is a collection of product engineering data related to the design and manufacture of an item or system. Product drawings and/or CAD models contain all of the descriptive documentation needed to ensure the competitive procurement of spare parts or end items
