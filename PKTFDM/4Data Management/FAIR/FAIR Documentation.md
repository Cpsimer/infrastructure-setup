# Documentation 
Documentation adds context to your data and makes the data easier to understand and reuse in the future. 
## What is documentation?
Imagine finding a dataset you created a long time ago. Now think of the contextual information that you would need to determine whether these data are relevant to your current research and whether you would be able to understand how they were created: What data? What data type? Who created the data? When? Where? In which context? By which method? … and so on.

Now, imagine finding a dataset that another researcher has produced. It contains a large table, where all column headers contain four-letter-abbreviations. If these abbreviations are not properly documented and resolved, you will never be able to understand nor use the data correctly. So, the more documentation of the data’s original context the better.
### Difference between documentation and metadata
Documentation and metadata are used as distinct concepts on this website. The documentation of your data adds richer contextual information and is meant to be read and understood by humans, while metadata are primarily meant to be processed by machines. The distinction between documentation and metadata is not always crystal clear and it is often grounded in pragmatic decisions
### 2 general types of data documentation 
We distinguish two general types of data documentation that must be included with your data to make them FAIR: data-level documentation and project-level (or: study-level) documentation.
#### Data-level documentation 
Data-level documentation includes information about specific data files like:
- data type 
- Structure of the data, e.g. questions, variables, concepts
- Data processing procedures
#### Project-level documentation 
Project- or study-level documentation describes:
- When, how and why the data were generated and by whom
- How the data were processed
- What quality assurance measures have been used
#### Example 
Within Carsten Brink’s research area, the researchers have collected patient data and now they document how they map the clinical data to a new structure following a standard ontology. This mapping step is necessary for distributed learning (their preferred method to provide access to sensitive data), but very time consuming. 

To ensure that their data can be understood by others, a data map like this one is included in their data-level documentation:

## While you work
While actively working on your research project, you collect and create, process, analyse, and interpret data. To ensure that your data are FAIR, you record the context of all research decisions, update your field or laboratory notebook, and keep track of all changes to your data
