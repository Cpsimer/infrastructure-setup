#### **4. Data Management and Digital Engineering**
This section focuses on the modern, data-centric approach to engineering.
*   **Digital Engineering Environment (DEE):**
    *   An interconnected framework of data, people, and processes.
    *   Emphasizes moving from document-centric to data-centric models.
    *   Includes components like Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Model-Based Definitions (MBD).
*   **Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs):**
    *   Defines how digital data (models, documents, reports) are delivered in contracts.
*   **Data Rights:**
    *   Ensures NASA has access to technical data through FAR clauses (e.g., Unlimited Rights, Government Purpose Rights).

#### **5. Software Engineering Requirements (per NPR 7150.2)**
This section details the rigorous process for developing and managing NASA software.
*   **Software Life Cycle:**
    *   **Requirements:** Critical phase for elicitation, analysis, and validation.
    *   **Architecture:** Underpins design; formalizes subsystem dependencies.
    *   **Design & Code:** The process of building the software components.
    *   **Testing:** Must verify code coverage and test COTS/GOTS components to the same level as custom code.
    *   **Operations, Maintenance & Retirement:** Planning for the full life cycle of the software.
*   **Supporting Processes:**
    *   **Configuration Management (SCM):** Tracking and evaluating all changes.
    *   **Risk Management:** Identifying and mitigating software-specific risks.
    *   **Measurements:** Collecting metrics like requirements volatility.
*   **Software Classifications:** Software is categorized by criticality:
    *   **Class A:** Human Space Flight Software (potential loss of life).
    *   **Class B:** Large-Scale, Mission-Critical Software (e.g., spacecraft control).
    *   **Class C-F:** Mission support, engineering tools, and general-purpose software with decreasing levels of criticality.
*   **Safety-Critical Software:**
    *   Requires special safety features and 100% code test coverage.

#### **6. Problem Management (per NASA-HDBK-8739.18)**
This defines the formal process for handling anomalies and nonconformances.
*   **Seven Step Problem Management Process:**
    1.  Problem Identification
    2.  Assessment and Investigation
    3.  Root Cause Determination
    4.  Problem Report (e.g., SPR - Significant Problem Report)
    5.  Corrective Action and Resolution
    6.  **Problem Recurrence Control and Lessons Learned (integrates with LLIS)**
    7.  Problem Disposition and Closure
*   **Support Processes:**
    *   **Data Mining:** Using algorithms (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees) to find unknown patterns in problem data.
    *   **Trend Analysis:** Searching for patterns and relationships in performance, problem, and programmatic data to forecast anomalies.

#### **7. Project Management Frameworks**
This section covers higher-level organizational methodologies.
*   **PTKM Framework (Project, Task, Knowledge Management):** A system for managing numerous long-term projects using dedicated project pages, action notes, and entry points.
*   **Productivity Methodologies:** References concepts like GTD (Getting Things Done) and PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) for information management.
*   **T-Rex (Technology Recommender System):** A machine learning model that classifies project data to recommend technologies and prevent knowledge gaps.
