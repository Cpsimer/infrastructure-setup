## Programs 
Characteristics of the program types are:

- Single-Project: These programs (e.g., James Webb Space Telescope) tend to have long development and operational lifetimes and represent a large investment of Agency resources. Multiple organizations or agencies contribute to them. Single-project programs have one project and implement their program objectives and requirements through one of two management approaches: (1) separate program and project structures or (2) a combined structure. The requirements for both programs and projects apply to single-project programs as described in this NPR.
- Uncoupled: These programs (e.g., Discovery Program) are implemented under a broad theme (like planetary science) and/or a common program implementation mechanism, such as providing flight opportunities for formally competed cost-capped projects or Principal Investigator (PI)-led missions and investigations. Each project in an uncoupled program is independent of the other projects within the program. 
- Loosely Coupled: These programs (e.g., Mars Exploration Program) address specific objectives through multiple space flight projects of varied scope. While each project has an independent set of mission objectives, the projects as a whole have architectural and technological synergies and strategies that benefit the program. For example, Mars orbiters designed for more than one Mars year in orbit are required to carry a communication system to support present and future landers.
- Tightly Coupled: These programs have multiple projects that execute portions of a mission or missions. No single project is capable of implementing a complete mission. Typically, multiple NASA Centers contribute to the program. Individual projects may be managed at different Centers. The program may also include other agency or international partner contributions.
