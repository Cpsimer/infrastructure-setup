## What is PARA?

PARA which stands for *Projects*, *Areas*, *Resources*, and *Archives*, is a method of folder organisation, which is focused on actionability. It is a simple, comprehensive and flexible way of structuring any type of digital information across platforms. ==PARA is the spiritual successor to the GTD Method, with a focus on making knowledge more actionable.==

## What is the structure of PARA?

Four top-level folders (*Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives*) each containing sub-folders dedicated to each individual active project, responsibility, interest, or inactive item from the other three top-level folders.

## Projects

> “A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”

You’ll have *Projects* that you’re actively working on, which are short-term efforts that are undertaken with a certain goal in mind. Examples of this are;

- Write a research report.
- Develop a new product feature.
- Renovate the apartment.
- Finish German language course.

## Area of Responsibility

> ”A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”

You’ll will have *Areas* in your life, which you are responsible for and require ongoing attention. Examples of this are;

- Work responsibilities, which could be Accounting, Product Development, and Marketing.
- Personal responsibilities, such as Health, Finances, Family, Writing, Travel, and Hobbies.

## Resources

> ”A topic or theme of ongoing interest.”

You’ll will come across digital *Resources* in your life, on a range of topics you are interested in and learning more about. Examples of this are;

- Personal productivity.
- Coding.
- Economics.
- German language.

## Archives

> ”Inactive items from the other three categories.”

Finally, you’ll have *Archived* items, which will include anything from the previous three categories that are no longer active but may want to save for future reference. Examples of this are;

- Projects you’ve completed or put on hold.
- Areas that are no longer active or relevant.
- Resources that you’re no longer interested in.

## Actionable Information

This method is about sorting information by its actionability. Scheduling reviews for each folder based on its actionability. The *Projects* folder will be frequently reviewed to check in on their progress, while the *Areas* folder will have less frequent reviews.

The *Resources* folder is only reviewed when you decide to take action on that topic, while the *Archives* folder is available but isn’t reviewed at all.

A reason to have *Projects* segregated from *Areas* relates to the Pareto Principle. It’s to separate the activities which generate an outcome, from the activities which don’t.

Building onto this idea, there is a clear line between things you are responsible for and what you are merely interested in. An *Area* is a role you take on in life, which has an ongoing standard to maintain, while *Resources* are interests you have and may change with time.

Additionally, information which is generated from *Projects* can move down the hierarchy to Areas if it’s something which becomes an ongoing responsibility. To *Resources* from intermediate work which has generated something of value for further reference. Or *Archives*, when an item is complete or inactive and you wish to save it for future reference.

## Organising Information for Actionable

This method comes with a simple convention for organising *Information* via actionable, directing where files shall be stored. Starting at the top of the list and moving down.

1. In which *Project* is this most useful?
2. If none, in which *Area* is this most useful?
3. If none, to which *Resource* does this belong?
4. If none, place it in *Archives*.

## Personal Criticism of PARA

PARA sets out to solve the problem of organising information in a way which makes it more actionable. Which is simple and easy to maintain, so it may endure a long time. However, its biases to rigid folder structure and lack of classification or relation, prove to be its greatest weakness for a PKM methodology.

In its simplest form, it adheres to a folder-like structure as its primary method of organisation. Files are stored within a sub-folder under one of four primary folders. A file cannot reside within two places at once. This means you have two choices, you can either;

- Copy files across folders, which leads to unnecessary duplicates and version control problems, or
- Sticking to the folder structure leads to friction and a lack of conceptual overlap.

Since the problems of duplicates and version control are self-evident, I will address the problems of friction and lack of conceptual overlap. A key requirement of any PKM is “…the effective acceleration of knowledge over time”. Meaning the PKM must enable the building upon and utilisation of stored information.

While learning an Academic Field, a subdivision of knowledge. One could think of a field as a branch, which is populated with concepts which make up the field, like leaves on a branch. These concepts may overlap with other fields or even be transmuted to serve a different purpose in a completely different field.

The idea of neatly categorising information by a field doesn’t reflect the real world, which is covered in The Myth of Academic Fields. This is a key issue, as a folder structure leads to siloing, which doesn’t facilitate the effective growth of knowledge. The alternative, while adhering to a folder structure, is storing files “flat” i.e. storing all files within one folder. Which creates discoverability issues.

It should be noted that the place where the files are held, could be seen as the *Archives*, as files which are not pulled into a *Project*, *Area* or *Resource*, will not be discoverable.

All of this shouldn’t be surprising, as PARA is defined as “A universal system for organising digital information”. The keyword there is “universal” If you want to make something genuinely universal, will imply that it has to be tool-agnostic and work across different environments and file formats.

It’s my personal opinion that if you were to undergo the task of building a PKM, it should be built to the environment and tools available. The above-mentioned “database with relations” is specific to certain environments where you have the ability to build PARA with a database. Otherwise, you have to accept the flaws of a folder method.

My final point is the separation and hierarchy of *Projects* and *Areas*. While *Projects* are normally represented to have a higher order than *Areas*, due to “actionability”. It’s more realistic to say that *Areas* have a higher sorting order than *Projects*, as *Projects* relate to *Areas*. Such as, ‘Develop a new product feature’ being a *Project* within the *Area* of ‘Product Development’.

If a *Project* is nested inside of an *Area*, the only distinction factor is whether the activity has a deadline or not. It would be more advantageous to consolidate the two and then define an activity by its intensity;

- By ‘active efforts and projects which are being worked on’,
- By ‘ongoing activities’, and
- By ‘back of mind activities’.

Viewing activities through a lens of intensity would allow for a better estimation of current effort, and more effective prioritization and adjustment of one bandwidth.
