## ==What is CODE?==

**CODE**, which stands for **Capture**, **Organize**, **Distil**, and **Express**, is a *PKM Framework* that governs the high-level process and overarching behavior, which prioritizes ‘Action-Oriented Knowledge Management’. Created by [Tiago Forte](https://archive.ph/o/prRq8/https://medium.com/u/7b122207920c).

*CODE* is grounded in the belief that true productivity lies in creating tangible outputs. This belief is seen in the approach that shaped each stage of *CODE*; From selectively *Capturing* material, *Organizing* it for actionability, *Distilling* the material for clarity, and ultimately *Expressing* concrete results.

## ==What is the behavior of CODE?==

*CODE’s* *PKM Cycle* is a *Linear* process of material and *Circular* processes of managing, contextualizing and converting material into usable assets. In addition, *CODE* primarily operates under a *Convergent* mode of thought except for the *Capture* stage, which is inherently *Divergent*, expanding the scope of inquiry.

## ==Capture: Keep what resonates==

*Capture* is about the act of intentionally collecting material, based on **Criteria**. These *Criteria* are created to guide the *Knowledge Worker* in what material they should collect.

> ==We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to let into our minds — Tiago Forte==

This “perspective” starts with realising that the value in all *Information* isn’t evenly distributed. The proliferation of “Information dilution” creates an environment of little valuable or relevant *Information* to the overall body of material.

> **General Rule:***Capture* no more than 10% of the *Information* consumed.

The purpose of creating *Criteria* is to extract and save only the most salient, relevant and rich material as possible. A general filtering process will look a little bit like this;

1. **“Does this material evoke a sense of inspiration?”**, the goal is to collect a bank of material to spark imagination, gain a new perspective or provide motivation.
2. **“Is this material useful to a current or future endeavor?”**, the goal is to collect material which is currently useful or potentially useful in the future.
3. **“Is this material personal?”**, the goal is to collect personal wisdom, such as thoughts, reflections, memories, and lessons learned.
4. **“Is this material surprising?”**, the goal is to collect material that breaks away from *Confirmation Bias*.

For an additional personal filtering process, [Tiago Forte](https://archive.ph/o/prRq8/https://medium.com/u/7b122207920c) recommends using the **Twelve Favorite Problems Method**.

## ==Organize: Save for actionability==

*Organize* is about the act of systematically classifying and arranging gathered material, based on an organizational method.

## ==Distil: Find the essence==

*Distil* is about the act of reducing material to its essence. The purpose is to begin the process of association and creating familiarity with the material by compressing the material down.

## ==Express: Show your work==

*Express* is about the act of generating a productive output from gathered material. This is done by taking the gathered and distilled material and creating small, concrete, individual building blocks which are used in the assembly of a project.

## Personal criticisms of CODE

In essence, *CODE* is about the transformation of material into actionable assets, ensuring that material directly contributes to a productive outcome. However, *CODE* lacks a critical aspect of having a *PKM* if uses a holistic framework and suffers from some confusing design choices, starting with the name.

It’s not uncommon for *Frameworks* in complex fields, to prioritize mnemonic or thematic coherence, which leads to oversimplification and forced categorization. In the case of the *CODE* acronym, while easy to remember, has come at the expense of depth and clarity.

*Distil* amalgamate several processes into one. Ideally, if these processes are distinct, they warrant separate stages for clarity. Similarly, *Express* covers both the creation of “Intermediate Packets” and the assembly of the final output.

This suggests an inconsistency in how the stages are defined and separated. If *Capture* and *Organize* are distinct due to their specific purpose, the same logic could apply to *Distil* and *Express*.

The *Progressive Summarization Method* could be viewed as starting in the *Capture* stage, summation within *Distil*, and the personal synthesis of material within the *Express* stage. If this were to be followed without consideration of personal synthesis and the *Integration* of material, then the emergence and the connection of ideas would be diminished.

The objective of the *Distil* stage is to recognise patterns between ideas, which is to be aided by reducing *Information* to its essence. While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that *Progressive Summarization* is the *Analysis* activity of the *Framework*, and the *Integration* process of consolidating and synthesizing new insights from emergent connections was left up to assumption.

The lack of emphasis on emergence is concerning. By focusing primarily on *Convergent* thinking, the *Framework* overlooks the importance of explicitly cultivating *Divergent* thinking necessary for emergence. Leading to a more narrowed focus and potentially missed innovative insights.

The practical solution is to view *Distil* as a two-phase activity; Firstly, *Progressively Summarise* material and then, actively engage in creative brainstorming or mind-mapping with the reduced materials.

*CODE’s* purpose of building a stockpile of “Intermediate Packets” to reduce the effort and time invested in future projects, comes with a cost. By *Capturing*, *Organising* and *Distilling*, it can be argued that the user has demonstrated an understanding of why it’s valuable, how it can be useful, and what is the core message. The user learns and deepens their *Knowledge* by familiarising themselves with the material.

However, I would argue that this is not learning. This would be an example of the **Collector’s Fallacy**, where the act of gathering *Information* into a central location, is mistaken for actually learning the material. It’s a subconscious misalignment of the objective, where gathering becomes the reward in itself, over learning it.

## How should it be used?

The *CODE Framework*, therefore, should be considered a contextualized *PKM Cycle* that’s focused on ‘Action-Oriented Knowledge Management’ for *Knowledge Workers* who wish to achieve a high volume of creative output. A *Knowledge Worker* who doesn’t have this primary focus should view *CODE* as a supplementary *PKM Framework* to another *PKM Framework*.
