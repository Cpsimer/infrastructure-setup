 Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the process of applying configuration
management throughout the software life cycle to ensure the completeness and correctness of
software configuration items. SCM applies technical and administrative direction and surveillance to identify and record the functional and physical characteristics of software configuration items,
control changes to those characteristics, record and report change processing and implementation
status, and verify compliance with specified requirements. SCM establishes and maintains the
integrity of the products of a software project throughout the software life cycle. Use of standard
Center or organizational SCM processes and procedures is encouraged where applicable
