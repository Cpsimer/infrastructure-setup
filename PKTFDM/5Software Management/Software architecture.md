Experience confirms that the quality and longevity of a software-reliant system is primarily determined by its architecture. The software architecture underpins a system’s software design and code; it represents the earliest design decisions, ones that are difficult and costly to change later. The transformation of the derived and allocated requirements into the software architecture results in the basis for all software development work. 

A documented software architecture that describes: the software’s structure;
identifies the software qualities (i.e., performance, modifiability, and security); identifies
the known interfaces between the software components and the components external to the
software (both software and hardware); identifies the interfaces between the software
components and identifies the software components

Rigorous specification languages, graphical representations, and related tools have been
developed to support the evaluation of critical properties at the design level

4.2.2 A software architecture:
- Formalizes precise subsystem decompositions.
- Defines and formalizes the dependencies among software work products within the integrated
system.
- Serves as the basis for evaluating the impacts of proposed changes.
- Maintains rules for use by subsequent software engineers that ensure a consistent software system as the work products evolve.
- Provides a stable structure for use by future groups through the documentation of the architecture, its views and patterns, and its rules.

Long term—Focusing on the end-to-end enterprise-level system/solution design and
roll-out strategies that drive toward implementation delivery (associated with) and sustainment
of the following:
- Identification and development of the technology roadmap based on desired end
state.
- Process alignment and optimization by proper application of enabling
technologies.
- Design consultation, including security, authentication, authorization, and
integration.
- Product capability deployment, features, and functionality.
- Automation processes and methodologies.
- Knowledge management, best practices, and reuse strategies.
- Performance of the role of the senior technical designer on the project.
- Drive the linkage/enablement of the designed architecture to domain processes
such as CDM, engineering release, change management, etc.
- Lead the development of the system and application architecture definition and
application configuration, including:
	- . Hardware and software components of the system.
	- Interfaces and interoperability.
	- Infrastructure and security.
	- Performance and reliability.
	- Administration and access control.
	- Maintenance and sustainment over time
