I use very few folders. I avoid folders because many of my entries belong to more than one area of thought. My system is oriented towards speed and laziness. I don’t want the overhead of having to consider where something should go.

I do not use nested sub-folders. I do not use the file explorer much for navigation. I mostly navigate using the quick switcher, backlinks, or links within a note.

My notes are primarily organized using the `categories` property. Categories display an overview of related notes, using the [bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) feature in Obsidian.

**Most of my notes are in the root of the vault**, not a folder. This where I write about my personal world: journal entries, essays, [evergreen](https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes) notes, and other personal notes. If a note is in the root, I know it’s something I wrote, or relates directly to me.

Two reference folders I use:

- **References** where I write about things that exist outside my world. Books, movies, places, people, podcasts, etc. Always named using the title e.g. `Book title.md` or `Movie title.md`.
- **Clippings** where I save things other people wrote, mostly essays and articles.

Three admin folders exist so that their contents don’t show up in the file navigation:

- **Attachments** for images, audio, videos, PDFs, etc.
- **Daily** for my daily notes, all named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. I do not write anything in daily notes, they exist solely to be linked to from other entries.
- **Templates** for templates.

Two folders are present in the downloadable version of my vault for the sake of clarity. In my personal vault, these notes would be in the root, not a folder.

- **Categories** contains top-level overviews of notes per category (e.g. Books, Movies, Podcasts, etc).
- **Notes** contains example notes.
