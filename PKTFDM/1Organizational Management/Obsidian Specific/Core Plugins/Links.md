I use internal links profusely throughout my notes. I try to always link the first mention of something. My journal entries are often a stream of consciousness cataloging recent events, finding connections between things. Often the link is _unresolved_, meaning that the note for that link isn’t created yet. Unresolved links are important because they are breadcrumbs for future connections between things.

A journal entry in the **root** of my vault might look something like this:

```
I went to see the movie [[Perfect Days]] with [[Aisha]] at [[Vidiots]] and had Filipino food at [[Little Ongpin]]. I loved this quote from Perfect Days: [[Next time is next time, now is now]]. It reminds me of the essay ...
```

The movie, movie theater, and restaurant each link to entries in my **References** folder. In these reference notes I capture properties, my rating, and thoughts about that thing. I use [Web Clipper](https://stephango.com/obsidian-web-clipper) to help populate properties from databases like IMDB. The quote was meaningful to me, so it became an [evergreen note](https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes) in my root folder. The essay I mention is in my **Clippings** folder, because I didn’t write it myself.

This heavy linking style becomes more useful as time goes on, because I can trace how ideas emerged, and the branching paths these ideas created.
