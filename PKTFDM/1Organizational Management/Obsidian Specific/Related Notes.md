One of my favorite use cases for Obsidian Bases is custom sidebar views. Here's one I made for "Related notes".

It finds notes that have overlapping links and tags with the active note. The notes are sorted by a count of overlaps. You can tailor this by counting and sorting other kinds of overlaps, like note titles, embeds, etc â€” possibly even creating a formula that adds weighting to the overlaps.

  and:
    - file.path != this.file.path

  LinksOverlap: formula.Related.length
  Related: list(this.file.links).filter(list(file.links).containsAny(value)).unique()
  TagsOverlap: list(this.file.tags).filter(list(file.tags).containsAny(value)).unique().length
properties:
  formula.LinksOverlap:

        - this.file.hasLink(file)
    order:
      - file.name
      - formula.Related
    sort:
      - property: formula.LinksOverlap
