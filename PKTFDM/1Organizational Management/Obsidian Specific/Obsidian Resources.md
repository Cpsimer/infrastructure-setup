## Obsidian Resources

Ye Olde Obsidian Resources page, courtsey of the Obsidian Roundup, which is currently experiencing my (annual?) DNS glitches.

If you are looking for past editions of the Roundup, I highly recommend checking them out on the hub: [üóÇÔ∏è Obsidian Roundup - Obsidian Hub - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Obsidian+Roundup/%F0%9F%97%82%EF%B8%8F+Obsidian+Roundup)

In the interests of efficiency (and a pathological avoidance of redundant work), this list is **not** intended to take the place of other Obsidian resources. It will, however, hopefully maintain a static ‚Äòstate of the meta‚Äô roundup of resources that might also be worth following along with, depending on your use-case. This is not necessarily exhaustive, and will skew towards things that get resurfaced often.

## Official

- For fast, synchronous discussion of potential bugs, the [Obsidian Members Group on Discord](https://obsidian.md/community) is probably your best bet, and the developers are very active there.
- The best place for longform, evergreen resources, workflow tips, and code snippets is the [Discourse forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/). This is definitely where bug reports and feature requests should go so they don‚Äôt get lost in the shuffle of Discord conversation. For ease of using it as an archival system, please, **please,** search before creating a new report.
- If you really hate live chats and creating new accounts, the [ObsidianMD reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/) does exist and is monitored by the Obsidian mod team.
- Note: Due to the incredible pace of development, it‚Äôs really hard to keep Obsidian-related documentation up to date. If you‚Äôd like to help, you can contribute on [the github repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-docs).
- The [getting started guide](https://dynalist.io/d/CQ4V16tFhIJIfy-rgDK7r1Bp) isn‚Äôt always the most cutting edge, but it has the benefit of being official. A quasi-official community-run alternative is the [Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/00+-+Start+here), which strives to collect showcases, templates, guides, workflows, courses, and resources (including the Obsidian roundup) into an organized, easy-to-search format. I **strongly** recommend starting there when looking for information, as it‚Äôs the most centralized resource I‚Äôm aware of. If you know of something that **isn‚Äôt** included, please consider submitting a pull request to add it!

## Personal Knowledge Management

- This roundup of [different classification & organization systems that can be leveraged for personal knowledge management](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/cataloging-classification-information-science-pkms-and-you/10071) is a great starting point.
- This [summary of How To Take Smart Notes](https://theknowledgeworker.substack.com/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian) is a fairly nice primer on how many people in the Obsidian community approach note-taking. `@joshduffney` has a more targeted [tutorial](https://www.knowledgeworker.blog/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian) on how to follow the Smart Notes philosophy.

## Workflows

- This [meta thread on various sync options](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-syncing-between-devices/20983) is meant to offer explanations of how to set up third party sync, which are not generally officially supported by the developers but do often work if you put in the setup time.
- This [dataview snippet showcase](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-plugin-snippet-showcase/13673) is an incredibly useful list of how one can leverage the incredibly powerful [dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), which was also the topic of the first Obsidian Community Talk. Here‚Äôs [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgzrRNkgsE&t=0s) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW5pD4SioFM) on YouTube. There‚Äôs also a channel in Discord where a lot of the Dataview experts hang out and help troubleshoot issues. I recommend checking out this [excellent beginner‚Äôs guide](https://denisetodd.medium.com/obsidian-dataview-for-beginners-a-checklist-to-help-fix-your-dataview-queries-11acc57f1e48) before asking questions there, though.
- This [meta thread on migration workflows](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-migration-workflows/15252) is meant to be a roundup of methods to people import/transfer from other tools.
- `@liam` maintains an [unofficial FAQ for plugin development](https://liamca.in/Obsidian/API+FAQ/index) that is pretty helpful. This [mini FAQ](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugins-mini-faq/7737) is also a handy place to start if you‚Äôre interested in developing plugins for Obsidian.

## Other Resources
