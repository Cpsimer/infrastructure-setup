Fractal journaling and randomization are how I tame the wilderness that a knowledge base can grow into.

Throughout the day I use Obsidian’s _unique note_ hotkey to write individual thoughts as they come up. This shortcut automatically creates a note with the prefix `YYYY-MM-DD HHmm` to which I may add a title that describes the idea.

Every few days I review these journal fragments and compile the salient thoughts. I then review those reviews monthly, and review the monthly reviews yearly (using [this template](https://stephango.com/40-questions)). The result is a fractal web of my life that I can zoom in and out of at varying degrees of detail. I can trace back where individual thoughts came from, and how they bubbled up into bigger themes.

Every few months I set aside time for a “random revisit”. I use the _random note_ hotkey to quickly travel randomly through my vault. I often use the local graph at shallow depth to see related notes. This helps me revisit old ideas, create missing links, and find inspiration in past thoughts. It’s also an opportunity to do maintenance, like fix formatting based on new rules in my personal style guide.

People have asked me if this could be automated with language models but I do not care to do so. I enjoy this process. Doing this maintenance helps me understand my own patterns. [Don’t delegate understanding](https://stephango.com/understand).
