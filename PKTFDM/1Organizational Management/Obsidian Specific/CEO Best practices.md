Rules I follow in my personal vault:

- Avoid splitting content into multiple vaults.
- Avoid folders for organization.
- Avoid non-standard Markdown.
- Always pluralize categories and tags.
- Use internal links profusely.
- Use YYYY-MM-DD dates everywhere.
- Use the 7-point scale for ratings.
- Keep [a single to-do list](https://stephango.com/todos) per week.
- [[use only core plugins]]

One of my favorite use cases for [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/) Bases is custom sidebar views. Here's one I made for "Related notes". It finds notes that have overlapping links and tags with the active note. The notes are sorted by a count of overlaps. You can tailor this by counting and sorting other kinds of overlaps, like note titles, embeds, etc — possibly even creating a formula that adds weighting to the overlaps.
