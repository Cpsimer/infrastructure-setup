## Appendix

I am starting a collection of interesting personal style choices. Please [send me examples](https://stephango.com/about) and I’ll add them to the list.

- [Scott Yu-Jan](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottYuJan) [paints all his tools white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GBPYRG9jM0).
- [2ynthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@2ynthetic) uses a [limited palette for outfits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xMo2PsLi3c) and [office decor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RqBrl0-qOA).
- [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) is a system to organize digital data.
- [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/@casey) labels everything [in his studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb60rrtTddQ) with paint markers.
- Ryan Hoover [never changes his profile picture](https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/why-i-never-change-my-profile-pic).
- Wes Anderson uses [the typeface Futura](https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/RoyalTenenbaumsWorldofFutura) in many of his films.
- [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) wore the same Issey Miyake black turtleneck and New Balance 991 shoes every day.

- Jesper Kouthoofd of [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/) [only uses lowercase](https://scandinavianmind.com/feature/human-touch-interview-jesper-kouthoofd-teenage-engineering) because uppercase communicates too much authority
- Osvaldo Cavandoli created the cartoon [La Linea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Linea_\(TV_series\)) using an animated white line, colored backgrounds, and unintelligible vocalizations
- obsidian Reminds me a lot of another business that I suspect would be right up your alley, that is if you're not already familiar - [https://usetrmnl.com/](https://usetrmnl.com/)
  
## [[Obsidian Philosophy]] 
Is there a word to describe [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/)'s business model? Revenue primarily comes from optional paid services that have free alternatives. "Freemium" isn't quite right because freemium apps typically paywall features, or have usage-based pricing. Obsidian doesn't do that, all the app features are free and there's no usage limit.
### obsidian blog 
Starting today, the Obsidian Commercial license is optional. Anyone can use Obsidian for work, for free. If Obsidian benefits your organization, you can still [purchase](https://obsidian.md/buy/license) Commercial licenses to support development.

Nothing else is changing. No account required, no ads, no tracking, no strings attached. Your data remains fully in your control, stored locally in plain text Markdown files. All features are available to you for free without limits.

Why make this change? Simplicity. The Commercial license terms were confusing and added unnecessary complexity to our pricing. Furthermore, as the [Obsidian Manifesto](https://obsidian.md/about) states: "_we believe that everyone should have the tools to think clearly and organize ideas effectively_". This change brings us closer to that principle.

People in over [10,000 organizations](https://obsidian.md/enterprise) use Obsidian. Many work in high-security environments, like government, cybersecurity, healthcare, and finance. Some of the largest organizations in the world, including Amazon and Google, have thousands of employees using Obsidian every day. These teams rely on Obsidian to think more effectively and keep total ownership over private data.

Previously, people at companies with two or more employees were required to purchase a Commercial license to use Obsidian for work. Going forward, the Commercial license is no longer required, but remains an optional way for organizations to support Obsidian, similar to the [Catalyst license](https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Catalyst+license) for individuals.

Organizations that support Obsidian are now featured on the [Obsidian Enterprise](https://obsidian.md/enterprise) page. Your organization can be showcased by purchasing 25 licenses or more.

Along with Commercial and Catalyst support, our add-on services, [Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) and [Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) help Obsidian remain [100% user-supported](https://stephango.com/vcware). In the future, we hope to offer more services designed for teams. As always, these will be optional.

### Ai agents
AI agents built into cloud apps will always be sub-par compared to state of the art agents that you can use with [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/). This is because your Obsidian data is in your control, in plain text formats that are ideal for LLMs to process.  
  
You can choose to run any of the best-in-class agents and AI tools: Claude, Gemini, OpenAI Codex, etc. You also have the choice to run local models and privacy-preserving options. Or you can use none of these and enjoy not seeing sparkly AI buttons everywhere.  
  
Remember that cloud-based note-taking apps are not end-to-end encrypted. This is inherently less secure, open to breaches, and allows companies to make your private thoughts part of their training set.  
  
Obsidian is not working on adding agents because we don't have to. We'll let the AI labs focus on that. We're 4 developers and our focus is on making great editing tools for plain text Markdown files that are always in your control.

*The speed of Apple Notes. The beauty of Bear. The productivity of Evernote. The extensibility of Obsidian.*

After countless hours of work and huge amounts of help from the fantastic Obsidian community ❤️, **Notebook Navigator** is now available for download in the **Obsidian Community Plugin** list!

**Notebook Navigator** is a **user interface replacement** that transforms Obsidian into what can best be described as a mashup of all the best features from **Apple Notes**, **Bear** and **Evernote** but with **tons** of new productivity features that those older applications miss!

**Want to work 100% with tags?** You got it. You have favorite tags, hidden tags, hierarchical tag trees, tag icons, tag colors, quick commands to add and remove tags, drag-to-tag, and so much more, such as the unique **clickable tags** displayed next to each file name. **Show tags on top**, make it your default interface!

**Love folders?** You got it too. You have folder notes, folder icons, folder colors, thumbnail previews, drag-and-drop, quick actions on hover, quick search, show files from subfolders, excluded folders, custom sort orders, custom appearances for each folder, pinned notes, middle-click to open note in new tab, and so much more!

Do you use **Dataview** or **Templater**? Or do you **develop plugins**? Notebook Navigator has a **comprehensive API** that allows you to retrieve the user's selected folder, react to navigation changes with event listeners, and pin files - opening up possibilities that Obsidian's standard API doesn't provide. Full documentation included!

Full **theme** and **Style Settings** support! All colors and visual styles are available in the **Style Settings** plugin so you can make Notebook Navigator look and feel just the way you like it! Complete CSS documentation included!

There is so much work behind this plugin that it is actually difficult just to write down all the features. Did I mention that it’s also super optimized for mobile devices including all phones and tablets? 

**Notebook Navigator is FREE and open source!**

[https://notebooknavigator.com/](https://notebooknavigator.com/)

Try it out and let me know if you love using it as much as I do!

**Under the hood**, Notebook Navigator is built for speed. It uses **React** with **TanStack Virtual** to deliver smooth scrolling even with 100,000+ notes. A dual-layer cache system (IndexedDB + RAM cache) provides instant metadata access for all files. It’s touch-optimized, mobile-friendly, and written in clean, type-safe TypeScript with zero ESLint warnings across 35,000 lines of code.

**About myself.** I’m Johan Sanneblad, have a PhD in software development, and have the past decades created over 100 apps and services together with companies like Apple, Electronic Arts, Google, Lego, Microsoft, SKF, Volvo Cars, Yamaha and many others. I love creating small details in software applications and making applications that appear simple but have lots of thoughtful logic under the hood. I use Obsidian every day for my weekly AI newsletter Tech Insights and plan to support and develop **Notebook Navigator** as long as there are people using it. Notebook Navigator is my third Obsidian plugin, I have also developed **Featured Image** and **Pixel Perfect Image**.

# Anti Big tech

## ChatGPT
OpenAI is now required by court order to preserve all ChatGPT logs including "temporary chats" and API requests that would have been deleted — if I understand this correctly, it means data retention policies for apps that use OpenAI API simply cannot be honored
